This project is a simple Python implementation of the Luhn Algorithm to check wheter a given credit card number is valid.
It accepts a credit card number as input.
It then splits digits into odd and even positions.
It then doubles digits in even positions and handles multi-digit results.
It calculates the total checksum.
It then validates the card number if the checksum is divisible by 10.
It can also be used for form validation in financial or E-Commerce applications.
